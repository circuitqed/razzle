P2: 5 pieces (O at c2, o at c1, e5, a8, b8)

P1 threatens: f6-f8 (pass to knight on goal row = win)
Only block: e5-f7 (only P2 piece that can reach f7)

Sequence:
1. P2 plays e5-f7 (knight blocks the f6-f8 pass line)
2. P1 can't win - the knight at f7 blocks the pass to f8
3. P1 makes some other move
4. P2 plays c2-c1 (ball to goal) - P2 WINS!
